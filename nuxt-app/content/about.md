My name is Geert and I am a master student at the Univeristy of Twente specializing in Embedded Systems. At my Bachelor in Music and Technology, I focused on using soft- and hardware to design new musical instruments and experiences. At my master I am deepening my knowledge of embedded devices and Real-Time computing. I aspire to become an Embedded Linux Engineer, working on projects that have a positive effect on people and the planet. Some of my other interests are open-source technology, making and windsurfing.

I am always in the pursuit of knowledge and improving my skills.
