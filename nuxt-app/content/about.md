A recent graduate form the master Embedded Systems at the University of Twente, currently based in ZÃ¼rich Switserland. I am passionate about creating software that makes full use of the hardware that it runs on. I'd love to spent my working days on improving the systems that benefit our society. Have a look around, my portfolio displays personal projects as well as bachelor and master projects that I am proud of.
