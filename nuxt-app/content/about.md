Hi! I am Geert and I am a master student at the Univeristy of Twente specializing in Embedded Systems. At my Bachelor in Music and Technology I focused on using soft- and hardware to design new musical instruments and experiences. At my master I am deepening my knowledge of embedded devices and Real-Time computing. I aspire to become an Embedded Linux Engineer, working on projects that have a positive effect on the people and planet. Fields like public transit and the energy transition intrest me. Furthermore, some of my other interests are open-source, tinkering and art.

<!--
I am always in the pursuit of knowledge and improving my skills.
