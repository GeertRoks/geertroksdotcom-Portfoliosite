OSTS (Offline Signal Testing Software) is a piece of software that is able to visualize any signal. It is a very useful tool when developing any plugin or other signal application in C++. Multiple signals can be layed on top of each other, to really understand how all signals influence each other.

This tool is developed during the fourth year of my bachelor at the Applied University of the Arts Utrecht, in collaboration with Bram Giesen. We needed a tool to vizualize the results of our DSP code and current software oscilloscope tools did not allow us to do that in the way we liked.

The tool is still under development with plans to improve even furhter on the user experience and analysis features.
