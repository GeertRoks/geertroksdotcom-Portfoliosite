title: NXP i.MX8M boot process security
description: Internship project where I researched the boot security measures of the NXP i.MX8M SoC in order for it to be deployed as edge device in the wild. Gathered detailed knowledge of Secure boot, ARM TrustZone, as well as inter-processor communication using RPMsg for the cooperation between an ARM application processor and ARM real-time processor.

During my master I took the opportunity to do an internship at Neways Technologies BV. in Enschede. For an ongoing project, they were interested in hardening the security of their NXP i.MX8M based edge device and asked me to research and report back on how to implement Secure Boot for it and possible other security features of the chip.
